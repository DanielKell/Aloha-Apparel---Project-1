The 3 main technologies used to create Aloha were:
    HTML,
    CSS,
    JavaScript

I also learned to install the flickity plugin as well as use JQuery on this project.

I feel that I've gained more knowledge in HTML and feel comfortable with it. I've also learned more about CSS but I do think that this is an area that I need to keep working on. I found one of the things that was most helpful in completing this project was redoing a lot of the CSS from the beginning.'
